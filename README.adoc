This repository contains the Antora components for the Hazelcast IMDG documentation.

The documentation source files are marked up with AsciiDoc.

== Docs Structure

This section describes some important information about how this repository is structured:

- The component name, version, and start page are configured in each branch's `antora.yml` file.
- The navigation for all modules is stored in the ROOT module's `nav.adoc` file.
- The {url-playbook}[docs site playbook] instructs Antora to automatically build the site using content in the `master` branch as well as any tags that are prefixed with *v*.

== Release Workflow

Documentation for new releases is hosted in versioned tags that are prefixed with `v`. For example, content for the `4.1.1` version is hosted in the `v4.1.1` tag. The `latest-dev` content is stored in the `master` branch

The documentation build process is triggered whenever you push a new tag to this repository or commit to the `master` branch.

=== Patch Releases

This section guides you through the steps for releasing documentation for patch releases.

. Find the `.z` branch for your version. For example, if you're working on content for version 4.1.2, find the branch named `4.1.z`.
+
TIP: For guidance on writing content, see the {url-contribute}[contribution guidelines].
+
NOTE: If a branch for your major or minor version does not exist, see <<major-and-minor-releases, Major and Minor Releases>>.

. When you are ready to release, create a new release branch from the `.z` branch and name it with the full version number that you are releasing. For example, if you are releasing version 4.1.1, name the branch 4.1.1.

. In the `antora.yml` file of your release branch, update the `version` field with the version of IMDG that you are working on.
+
[source,yaml]
----
version: 4.1.1
----

. Tag the latest commit in your release branch with a `v` followed by the version number.

. If you have made any changes since creating your release branch, merge those changes back into the `.z` branch.

. Delete your release branch.
+
WARNING: Do not delete the `.z` branch. This branch is for writing content for future patch releases.

. In the `antora.yml` file of the `.z` branch, increment the `version` field. For example, `4.1.2-SNAPSHOT` becomes `4.1.3-SNAPSHOT`.

. If you are releasing a new latest version, in the `develop` branch of the `hazelcast/hazelcast-docs` repository, submit a pull request to update the `_redirects` file with your release version of IMDG.
+
NOTE: This file is where we alias the `latest` path in URLs.
+
[source,bash]
----
# Redirect latest imdg alias to the latest version
/imdg/latest/*  /imdg/4.1.1/:splat 200!
----

The documentation site will now be built, including content from your tagged version.

== Major and Minor  Releases

This section guides you through the steps for releasing documentation for major and minor releases.

. Create a `\{version\}.z` branch from the `master` branch, where `\{version\}` is the version of IMDG that you are releasing. For example, if you're working on content for version 5.0, create a branch named `5.0.z`.
+
TIP: For guidance on writing content, see the {url-contribute}[contribution guidelines].

. When you are ready to release, create a new release branch from the `.z` branch and name it with the full version number that you are releasing. For example, if you are releasing version 5.0, name the branch 5.0.

. In the `antora.yml` file of your release branch, update the `version` field with the version of IMDG that you are working on.
+
[source,yaml]
----
version: 5.0
----

. Tag the latest commit in your release branch with a `v` followed by the version number.

. If you have made any changes since creating your release branch, merge those changes back into the `.z` branch.

. Delete your release branch.
+
WARNING: Do not delete the `.z` branch. This branch is for writing content for future patch releases.

. In the `antora.yml` file of the `.z` branch, increment the `version` field. For example, `5.0-SNAPSHOT` becomes `5.0.1-SNAPSHOT`.

. If you are releasing a new `latest-dev` version, in the `antora.yml` file of the `master` branch, increment the `version` field to the `latest-dev` version. For example, `5.0-SNAPSHOT` becomes `5.1.0-SNAPSHOT`.

. In the `develop` branch of the `hazelcast/hazelcast-docs` repository, submit a pull request to update the `_redirects` file with the new versions of IMDG.
+
NOTE: This file is where we alias the `latest-dev` and `latest` paths in URLs.
+
[source,bash]
----
# Redirect latest imdg alias to the latest version
/imdg/latest/*  /imdg/5.0/:splat 200!
# Redirect latest-dev imdg alias to the latest-dev version
/imdg/latest-dev/*  /imdg/5.1-snapshot/:splat 200!

The documentation site will now be built, including content from your tagged version.
