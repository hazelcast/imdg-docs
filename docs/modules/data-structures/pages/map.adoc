= Map
[[map]]

Hazelcast Map (`IMap`) extends the interface `java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentMap`
and hence `java.util.Map`. It is the distributed implementation of Java map. You can
perform operations like reading and writing from/to a Hazelcast map with the well
known get and put methods.

'''
NOTE: IMap data structure can also be used by https://jet.hazelcast.org/[Hazelcast Jet^]
for Real-Time Stream Processing (by enabling the Event Journal on your map) and
Fast Batch Processing. Hazelcast Jet uses IMap as a source (reads data from IMap) and as a sink
(writes data to IMap). See the https://hazelcast.org/use-cases/fast-batch-processing/[Fast Batch Processing^]
and https://hazelcast.org/use-cases/real-time-stream-processing/[Real-Time Stream Processing^]
use cases for Hazelcast Jet. See also https://jet-start.sh/docs/api/sources-sinks#imap[here^]
in the Hazelcast Jet Programming Guide to learn how Jet uses IMap, i.e., how it can read from and write to IMap.

[[getting-a-map-and-putting-an-entry]]
== Getting a Map and Putting an Entry

Hazelcast partitions your map entries and their backups, and almost evenly distribute
them onto all Hazelcast members. Each member carries approximately
"number of map entries * 2 * 1/n" entries, where **n** is the number of members in the cluster.
For example, if you have a member with 1000 objects to be stored in the cluster and then you
start a second member, each member will both store 500 objects and back up the 500 objects
in the other member.

Let's create a Hazelcast instance and fill a map named `Capitals` with key-value pairs
using the following code. Use the HazelcastInstance `getMap` method to get the map,
then use the map `put` method to put an entry into the map.

[source,java]
----
HazelcastInstance hzInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();
Map<String, String> capitalcities = hzInstance.getMap( "capitals" );
    capitalcities.put( "1", "Tokyo" );
    capitalcities.put( "2", "Paris" );
    capitalcities.put( "3", "Washington" );
    capitalcities.put( "4", "Ankara" );
    capitalcities.put( "5", "Brussels" );
    capitalcities.put( "6", "Amsterdam" );
    capitalcities.put( "7", "New Delhi" );
    capitalcities.put( "8", "London" );
    capitalcities.put( "9", "Berlin" );
    capitalcities.put( "10", "Oslo" );
    capitalcities.put( "11", "Moscow" );
    ...
    capitalcities.put( "120", "Stockholm" );
----

When you run this code, a cluster member is created with a map whose entries are
distributed across the members' partitions. See the below illustration. For now,
this is a single member cluster.

image:ROOT:1Node.png[Map Entries in a Single Member]

NOTE: Please note that some of the partitions do not contain any data entries since
we only have 120 objects and the partition count is 271 by default. This count is
configurable and can be changed using the system property `hazelcast.partition.count`.
See the xref:ROOT:system-properties.adoc[System Properties appendix].

[[creating-a-member-for-map-backup]]
== Creating A Member for Map Backup

Now let's create a second member by running the above code again. This creates a
cluster with two members. This is also where backups of entries are created - remember
the backup partitions mentioned in the xref:overview:hazelcast-overview.adoc[Hazelcast Overview section].
The following illustration shows two members and how the data and its backup is distributed.

image:ROOT:2Nodes.png[Map Entries with Backups in Two Members]

As you see, when a new member joins the cluster, it takes ownership and loads some of the
data in the cluster. Eventually, it will carry almost "(1/n `*` total-data) + backups" of the data,
reducing the load on other members.

`HazelcastInstance.getMap()` returns an instance of `com.hazelcast.map.IMap` which extends
the `java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentMap` interface. Methods like
`ConcurrentMap.putIfAbsent(key,value)` and `ConcurrentMap.replace(key,value)` can be used
on the distributed map, as shown in the example below.

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/dds/map/BasicMapOperations.java[tag=bmo]
----

All `ConcurrentMap` operations such as `put` and `remove` might wait if the key is locked
by another thread in the local or remote JVM. But, they will eventually return with success.
`ConcurrentMap` operations never throw a `java.util.ConcurrentModificationException`.

[[backing-up-maps]]
== Backing Up Maps

Hazelcast distributes map entries onto multiple cluster members (JVMs). Each member
holds some portion of the data.

Distributed maps have one backup by default. If a member goes down, your data is recovered
using the backups in the cluster. There are two types of backups as described below: _sync_ and _async_.

[[creating-sync-backups]]
=== Creating Sync Backups

To provide data safety, Hazelcast allows you to specify the number of backup copies you
want to have. That way, data on a cluster member is copied onto other member(s).

To create synchronous backups, select the number of backup copies using the `backup-count` property.

[source,yaml]

hazelcast:
  map:
    default:
      backup-count: 1
----
====

When this count is 1, a map entry will have its backup on one other member in the cluster.
If you set it to 2, then a map entry will have its backup on two other members.
You can set it to 0 if you do not want your entries to be backed up, e.g., if performance
is more important than backing up. The maximum value for the backup count is 6.

Hazelcast supports both synchronous and asynchronous backups. By default, backup operations
are synchronous and configured with `backup-count`. In this case, backup operations block
operations until backups are successfully copied to backup members (or deleted from backup
members in case of remove) and acknowledgements are received. Therefore, backups are updated
before a `write`(put, set, remove and their async counterparts) operation is completed,
provided that the cluster is stable. Sync backup operations have a blocking cost which may
lead to latency issues.

[[creating-async-backups]]
=== Creating Async Backups

Asynchronous backups, on the other hand, do not block operations. They are fire & forget and
do not require acknowledgements; the backup operations are performed at some point in time.

To create asynchronous backups, select the number of async backups with the `async-backup-count`
property. An example is shown below.

See xref:consistency-and-replication:consistency.adoc[Consistency and Replication Model] for more detail.

NOTE: Backups increase memory usage since they are also kept in memory.

NOTE: A map can have both sync and async backups at the same time.

[[enabling-backup-reads]]
=== Enabling Backup Reads

By default, Hazelcast has one sync backup copy. If `backup-count` is set to more than 1, then
each member will carry both owned entries and backup copies of other members. So for the `map.get(key)`
call, it is possible that the calling member has a backup copy of that key. By default, `map.get(key)`
always reads the value from the actual owner of the key for consistency.

To enable backup reads (read local backup entries), set the value of the `read-backup-data` property
to **true**. Its default value is **false** for consistency. Enabling backup reads can improve
performance but on the other hand it can cause stale reads while still preserving monotonic-reads property.

----
====

This feature is available when there is at least one sync or async backup.

Please note that if you are performing a read from a backup, you should take into account that
your hits to the keys in the backups are not reflected as hits to the original keys on the primary
members. This has an impact on IMap's maximum idle seconds or time-to-live seconds expiration.
Therefore, even though there is a hit on a key in backups, your original key on the primary member may expire.

NOTE: Backup reads that are requested by Hazelcast clients are ignored since this operation
is performed on the local entries.

[[map-eviction]]
== Map Eviction

Hazelcast maps have no restrictions on the size and may grow arbitrarily
large, by default. Unless you delete the map entries manually or use an
eviction policy, they will remain in the map. When it comes to reducing the size of a map, there are two concepts: expiration and eviction.

Expiration puts a limit on the maximum lifetime of an entry stored inside the map.
When the entry expires it cannot be retrieved from the map any longer and at some point
in time it will be cleaned out from the map to free up the memory. You can configure the expiration,
and hence the eviction based on the expiration, using the elements `time-to-live-seconds`
and `max-idle-seconds` as described in <<configuring-map-eviction>> below.

Eviction puts a limit on the maximum size of the map. If the size of the map grows larger than
the maximum allowed size, an eviction policy decides which item to evict from the map to reduce
its size. You can configure the maximum allowed size and eviction policy using the elements
`size` and `eviction-policy` as described in <<configuring-map-eviction>> below.

Eviction and expiration can be used together. In this case, the expiration configurations
(`time-to-live-seconds` and `max-idle-seconds`) continue to work as usual cleaning out the
expired entries regardless of the map size. Note that locked map entries are not the subjects
for eviction and expiration.

Hazelcast Map uses the same eviction mechanism as our JCache implementation.
See the xref:jcache:icache.adoc#eviction-algorithm[Eviction Algorithm section] for details.

[[understanding-map-eviction]]
=== Understanding Map Eviction

Hazelcast Map performs eviction based on partitions. For example, when you specify a size using
the `PER_NODE` attribute for `max-size` (see the <<configuring-map-eviction, Configuring Map Eviction section>>),
Hazelcast internally calculates the maximum size for every partition. Hazelcast uses the following
equation to calculate the maximum size of a partition:

```
partition-maximum-size = max-size * member-count / partition-count
```

NOTE: If the `partition-maximum-size` is less than 1 in the equation above, it will be set to 1
(otherwise, the partitions would be emptied immediately by eviction due to the exceedance of
`max-size` being less than 1).

The eviction process starts according to this calculated partition maximum size when you try
to put an entry. When entry count in that partition exceeds partition maximum size, eviction
starts on that partition.

Assume that you have the following figures as examples:

* partition count: 200
* entry count for each partition: 100
* `max-size` (PER_NODE): 20000

The total number of entries here is 20000 (partition count * entry count for each partition).
This means you are at the eviction threshold since you set the `max-size` to 20000. When you
try to put an entry:

. the entry goes to the relevant partition
. the partition checks whether the eviction threshold is reached (`max-size`)
. only one entry will be evicted.

As a result of this eviction process, when you check the size of your map, it is 19999. After
this eviction, subsequent put operations do not trigger the next eviction until the map size
is again close to the `max-size`.

NOTE: The above scenario is simply an example that describes how the eviction process works.
Hazelcast finds the most optimum number of entries to be evicted according to your cluster
size and selected policy.

[[configuring-map-eviction]]
=== Configuring Map Eviction

The following is an example declarative configuration for map eviction.

NOTE: Some map entries are not always evicted or expired according to their `time-to-live` or `max-idle-seconds` configurations. To fix this issue, you must set the `per-entry-stats-enabled` property to `true`. For details about this issue, see the link:https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/19483[pull request on GitHub].

====

The following are the configuration element descriptions:

* `time-to-live-seconds`: Maximum time in seconds for each entry to stay in the map (TTL).
It limits the lifetime of the entries relative to the time of the last write access
performed on them. If it is not 0, the entries whose lifetime exceeds this period
(without any write access performed on them during this period) are expired and
evicted automatically. An individual entry may have its own lifetime limit by
using one of the methods accepting a TTL; see <<evicting-specific-entries, Evicting Specific Entries section>>.
If there is no TTL value provided for the individual entry, it inherits the value
set for this element. Valid values are integers between 0 and `Integer.MAX VALUE`.
Its default value is 0, which means infinite (no expiration and eviction). If it is not 0,
entries are evicted regardless of the set `eviction-policy` described below.
* `max-idle-seconds`: Maximum time in seconds for each entry to stay idle in
the map. It limits the lifetime of the entries relative to the time of the
last read or write access performed on them. The entries whose idle period
exceeds this limit are expired and evicted automatically. An entry is idle
if no `get`, `put`, `EntryProcessor.process` or `containsKey` is called on
it. Valid values are integers between 0 and `Integer.MAX VALUE`.
Its default value is 0, which means infinite.
+
NOTE: Setting this property to 1 second expires the entry after 1 second, regardless of
the operations done on that entry in-between, due to the loss of millisecond
resolution on the entry timestamps. Assume that you create a record at time = 1 second
(1000 milliseconds) and access it at wall clock time 1100 milliseconds and
then again at 1400 milliseconds. In this case, the entry is deemed as not touched.
So, setting this property to 1 second is not supported.
+
NOTE: Both `time-to-live-seconds` and `max-idle-seconds` may be used simultaneously on
the map entries. In that case, the entry is considered expired if at least one of the
policies marks it as expired.
+
* `eviction`: By default map has no eviction configured.
To make it work you have to configure it using the following attributes of
this element:
** `eviction-policy`: Eviction policy to be applied when the size of map grows larger than
the value specified by the `size` element described below.  Valid values are:
*** NONE: Default policy. If set, no items are evicted and the property `size` described
below is ignored. You still can combine it with `time-to-live-seconds` and `max-idle-seconds`.
*** LRU: Least Recently Used.
*** LFU: Least Frequently Used.
+
Apart from the above values, you can also develop and use your own eviction policy.
See the <<custom-eviction-policy, Custom Eviction Policy section>>.
+
** `size`: Maximum size of the map. When maximum size is reached, the map is evicted
based on the policy defined. Valid values are integers between 0 and `Integer.MAX VALUE`.
Its default value is 0, which means infinite. If you want `size` to work, set the
`eviction-policy` property to a value other than `NONE`. Its attributes are described below.
** `max-size-policy`: Maximum size policy for eviction of the map. Available values are as follows:
*** `PER_NODE`: Maximum number of map entries in each cluster member. This is the default policy.
*** `PER_PARTITION`: Maximum number of map entries within each partition. Storage size depends
on the partition count in a cluster member. This attribute should not be used often. For instance,
avoid using this attribute with a small cluster. If the cluster is small, it hosts more partitions,
and therefore map entries, than that of a larger cluster. Thus, for a small cluster, eviction of
the entries decreases performance (the number of entries is large).
*** `USED_HEAP_SIZE`: Maximum used heap size in megabytes per map for each Hazelcast instance.
Please note that this policy does not work when <<setting-in-memory-format, in-memory format>>
is set to `OBJECT`, since the memory footprint cannot be determined when data is put as `OBJECT`.
*** `USED_HEAP_PERCENTAGE`: Maximum used heap size percentage per map for each Hazelcast instance.
If, for example, a JVM is configured to have 1000 MB and this value is 10, then the map entries
will be evicted when used heap size exceeds 100 MB. Please note that this policy does not work
when <<setting-in-memory-format, in-memory format>> is set to `OBJECT`, since the memory footprint
cannot be determined when data is put as `OBJECT`.
*** `FREE_HEAP_SIZE`: Minimum free heap size in megabytes for each JVM.
*** `FREE_HEAP_PERCENTAGE`: Minimum free heap size percentage for each JVM. If, for example, a JVM
is configured to have 1000 MB and this value is 10, then the map entries will be evicted when
free heap size is below 100 MB.
*** `USED_NATIVE_MEMORY_SIZE`: ([navy]*Hazelcast IMDG Pro and Enterprise*) Maximum used native memory
size in megabytes per map for each Hazelcast instance.
*** `USED_NATIVE_MEMORY_PERCENTAGE`: ([navy]*Hazelcast IMDG Pro and Enterprise*) Maximum used native
memory size percentage per map for each Hazelcast instance.
*** `FREE_NATIVE_MEMORY_SIZE`: ([navy]*Hazelcast IMDG Pro and Enterprise*) Minimum free native memory
size in megabytes for each Hazelcast instance.
*** `FREE_NATIVE_MEMORY_PERCENTAGE`: ([navy]*Hazelcast IMDG Pro and Enterprise*) Minimum free native
memory size percentage for each Hazelcast instance.`

==== Fine-Tuning Map Eviction

Besides the above configuration elements and attributes you can fine-tune
the eviction related to the entry counts to be evicted using the following
Hazelcast properties:

* `hazelcast.map.eviction.batch.size`: Specifies the maximum number of map entries
that are evicted during a single eviction cycle. Its default value is 1, meaning
at most 1 entry is evicted, which is typically fine.
However, when you insert values during an eviction cycle, each iteration doubles the entry size.
In this situation more than just a single entry should be evicted.
* `hazelcast.map.eviction.sample.count`: Whenever a map eviction is required, a new sampling starts by the built-in sampler.
The sampling algorithm selects a random sample from the underlying data storage and
it results in a set of map entries. This property specifies the entry count of this sample. Its default value is 15.

See also the xref:jcache:icache.adoc#eviction-algorithm[Eviction Algorithm section] to learn more details on evicting entries.

[[evicting-specific-entries]]
=== Evicting Specific Entries

The eviction policies and configurations explained above apply to all the entries of a map.
The entries that meet the specified eviction conditions are evicted.

If you want to evict some specific map entries, you can use the `ttl` and `ttlUnit` parameters of
the method `map.put()`. An example code line is given below.

`myMap.put( "1", "John", 50, TimeUnit.SECONDS )`

The map entry with the key "1" will be evicted 50 seconds after it is put into `myMap`.

You may also use `map.setTTL` method to alter the time-to-live value of an existing entry.
It is done as follows:

`myMap.setTTL( "1", 50, TimeUnit.SECONDS )`

In addition to the `ttl`, you may also specify a maximum idle timeout for specific map entries
using the `maxIdle` and `maxIdleUnit` parameters:

`myMap.put( "1", "John", 50, TimeUnit.SECONDS, 40, TimeUnit.SECONDS )`

Here `ttl` is set as 50 seconds and `maxIdle` is set as 40 seconds. The entry is considered to
be evicted if at least one of these policies marks it as expired. If you want to specify only
the `maxIdle` parameter, you need to set `ttl` as 0 seconds.

[[evicting-all-entries]]
=== Evicting All Entries

To evict all keys from the map except the locked ones, use the method `evictAll()`.
If a MapStore is defined for the map, `deleteAll` is not called by `evictAll`. If
you want to call the method `deleteAll`, use `clear()`.

An example is given below.

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/dds/map/EvictAll.java[tag=evictall]
----

NOTE: Only EVICT_ALL event is fired for any registered listeners.

[[forced-eviction]]
==== Forced Eviction

[blue]*Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise*

Hazelcast may use forced eviction in the cases when the eviction
explained in <<understanding-map-eviction, Understanding Map Eviction>>
is not enough to free up your memory. Note that this is valid if
you are using [blue]*Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise* and you set your
in-memory format to `NATIVE`.

The forced eviction mechanism is explained below as steps in the
given order:

* When the normal eviction is not enough, forced eviction is
triggered and first it tries to evict approx. 20% of the entries
from the current partition. It retries this five times.
* If the result of above step is still not enough, forced eviction
applies the above step to all maps. This time it might perform eviction
from some other partitions too, provided that they are owned by the same
thread.
* If that is still not enough to free up your memory, it evicts not the
20% but all the entries from the current partition.
* If that is not enough, it will evict all the entries from the other
data structures; from the partitions owned by the local thread.

Finally, when all the above steps are not enough, Hazelcast throws
a native `OutOfMemoryException`.

When you have an evictable cache/map, you should safely put
entries to it without facing with any memory shortages.
Forced eviction helps to achieve this. Regular eviction
removes one entry at a time while forced eviction can remove
multiple entries, which can even be owned by another caches/maps.

[[custom-eviction-policy]]
=== Custom Eviction Policy

Apart from the policies such as LRU and LFU, which Hazelcast provides out-of-the-box,
you can develop and use your own eviction policy.

To achieve this, you need to provide an implementation of `MapEvictionPolicyComparator` as in
the following `OddEvictor` example:

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/dds/map/MapCustomEvictionPolicyComparator.java[tag=mcep]
----

Then you can enable your policy by setting it via the method
`MapConfig.getEvictionConfig().setComparatorClassName()`
programmatically or via XML declaratively. Following is the example
declarative configuration for the eviction policy `OddEvictor` implemented above:

[[setting-in-memory-format]]
== Setting In-Memory Format

IMap (and a few other Hazelcast data structures, such as ICache)
has an `in-memory-format` configuration option. By default, Hazelcast
stores data into memory in binary (serialized) format. Sometimes it can
be efficient to store the entries in their object form, especially in cases
of local processing, such as entry processor and queries.

Specify the `in-memory-format` element in the configuration to set how the
data will be stored in the memory. You have the following format options:

* `BINARY` (default): The data (both the key and value) is stored in serialized
binary format. You can use this option if you mostly perform regular map
operations, such as `put` and `get`.
* `OBJECT`: The data is stored in deserialized form. This configuration is
good for maps where xref:computing:entry-processor.adoc[entry processing] and xref:query:how-distributed-query-works.adoc[queries] form the majority of all
operations and the objects are complex, making the serialization cost comparatively
high. By storing objects, entry processing does not contain the deserialization
cost. Note that when you use `OBJECT` as the in-memory format, the key is still
stored in binary format and the value is stored in object format.
* `NATIVE`: ([navy]*Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise*) This format behaves the same as
BINARY, however, instead of on-heap memory, keys and values are stored in the off-heap
memory.

Regular operations like `get` rely on the object instance. When the `OBJECT` format
is used and a `get` is performed, the map does not return the stored instance,
but creates a clone. Therefore, this whole `get` operation first includes a
serialization on the member owning the instance and then a deserialization on
the member calling the instance. When the `BINARY` format is used, only a
deserialization is required; `BINARY` is faster.

Similarly, a `put` operation is faster when the `BINARY` format is used. If the
format was `OBJECT`, the map would create a clone of the instance, and there would
first be a serialization and then a deserialization. When BINARY is used, only a
deserialization is needed.

NOTE: If a value is stored in `OBJECT` format, a change on a returned value does not
affect the stored instance. In this case, the returned instance is not the actual one
but a clone. Therefore, changes made on an object after it is returned will not reflect
on the actual stored data. Similarly, when a value is written to a map and the value is
stored in `OBJECT` format, it will be a copy of the `put` value. Therefore, changes made
on the object after it is stored will not reflect on the stored data.

[[using-high-density-memory-store-with-map]]
== Using High-Density Memory Store with Map

[navy]*Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise HD*

Hazelcast instances are Java programs. In case of `BINARY` and `OBJECT` in-memory
formats, Hazelcast stores your distributed data into the heap of its server instances.
Java heap is subject to garbage collection (GC). In case of larger heaps, garbage
collection might cause your application to pause for tens of seconds (even minutes
for really large heaps), badly affecting your application performance and response times.

As the data gets bigger, you either run the application with larger heap, which would
result in longer GC pauses or run multiple instances with smaller heap which can turn
into an operational nightmare if the number of such instances becomes very high.

To overcome this challenge, Hazelcast offers High-Density Memory Store for your maps.
You can configure your map to use High-Density Memory Store by setting the in-memory
format to `NATIVE`. The following snippet is the declarative configuration example.

Keep in mind that you should have already enabled the High-Density Memory Store
usage for your cluster. See the xref:storage:high-density-memory.adoc#configuring-high-density-memory-store[Configuring High-Density Memory Store section].

You can also benefit from the persistent memory technologies such as
Intel(R) Optane(TM) DC to be used by the High-Density Memory Store. See the
xref:storage:high-density-memory.adoc#using-persistent-memory[Using Persistent Memory section].

[[required-configuration-changes-when-using-native]]
=== Required Configuration Changes When Using NATIVE

Note that the eviction mechanism is different for `NATIVE` in-memory format.
The new eviction algorithm for map with High-Density Memory Store is similar
to that of JCache with High-Density Memory Store and is described xref:jcache:icache.adoc#eviction-algorithm[here].

== Metadata Policy

Hazelcast IMap offers automatic preprocessing of various data types on the
update time to make queries faster. It is currently supported only by the
xref:query:how-distributed-query-works.adoc#querying-json-strings[HazelcastJsonValue] type. When metadata creation
is on, IMap creates additional metadata about the objects of supported types
and uses this metadata during the querying. It does not affect the latency
and throughput of the object of any type except the supported types.

This feature is on by default. You can configure it using the `metadata-policy`
configuration element.

[[loading-and-storing-persistent-data]]
== Loading and Storing Persistent Data

In some cases, you may want to load and store distributed map entries
from/to a persistent data store such as a relational database. For example,
if you want to back up your map entries or if you want to check your database
for updated data entries. To do this,
you can use Hazelcast's link:{javadocBaseUrl}{full-version}/javadoc/com/hazelcast/map/MapStore.html[`MapStore`] and
link:{javadocBaseUrl}{full-version}/javadoc/com/hazelcast/map/MapLoader.html[`MapLoader`] interfaces.

[cols="1m,5a"]
|===
|Interface| Description

|MapLoader
|This method checks the map for a requested value.
If the requested value does not exist in memory, the `MapLoader.load()` method
tries to load it from the data store. If the value is loaded from the data store,
it remains in memory until it is removed or evicted.

|MapStore
|This method stores the contents of a map in the data store.

NOTE: The data store that you choose must be a centralized system that
is accessible from all Hazelcast members. Persistence to a local file system is not supported.

|===

The following example shows you how to implement the `MapStore` interface.

NOTE: The `MapStore` interface extends the `MapLoader` interface.
Therefore, all methods and configuration parameters of the `MapLoader`
interface are also available on the `MapStore` interface.

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/dds/map/PersonMapStore.java[tag=personms]
----

During the initial loading process, the `MapStore` interface uses an ExecutorService thread, not a partition thread, in order to avoid affecting ongoing partition operations. After the initial loading process, the `IMap.get()` and `IMap.put()` methods use a partition thread.

NOTE: Each member receives an instance of the `MapStore` implementation, which means that multiple threads can access it at the same time. If you use multiple threads to access shared state in a `MapStore` implementation,  you need to make sure that the implementation is thread safe.

NOTE: `MapStore` or `MapLoader` implementations should not use Hazelcast Map/Queue/MultiMap/List/Set operations. Your implementation should
only work with your data store. Otherwise, you may get into deadlock situations.

NOTE: To monitor the `MapLoader` instance for each loaded entry,
use the `EntryLoadedListener` interface. See the
xref:events:object-events.adoc#listening-for-map-events[Listening for Map Events section]
to learn how you can catch entry-based events.

=== Setting Expiration Times on Loaded and Stored Data Entries

Entries loaded by `MapLoader` implementations do not have a set time-to-live property.
Therefore, they live until evicted or explicitly removed. To enforce expiration
times on the entries, you can use the `EntryLoader` and `EntryStore` interfaces.

NOTE: These interfaces extend the `MapLoader` and `MapStore` interfaces.
Therefore, all methods and configuration parameters of the `MapLoader` and
`MapStore` implementations are also available on the `EntryLoader` and `EntryStore` implementations.

`EntryLoader` allows you to set time-to-live values per key before
handing the values to Hazelcast. Therefore, you can store and load
key-specific time-to-live values in the external storage.

Similar to `EntryLoader`, in order to store custom expiration times associated
with the entries, you may use `EntryStore`. `EntryStore` allows you to retrieve
associated expiration date for each entry. The expiration date is an offset
from an epoch in milliseconds. Epoch is January 1, 1970 UTC which is used
by `System.currentTimeMillis()`.

NOTE: Although the expiration date is expressed in milliseconds, expiration
dates are rounded to the nearest lower whole second because the `IMap` interface
uses second granularity when it comes to expiration.

The following example shows you how to implement the `EntryStore` interface.

[[using-read-through-persistence]]
=== Using Read-Through Persistence

If an entry does not exist in memory when an application asks for it,
Hazelcast asks the loader implementation to load that entry from the
data store.  If the entry exists there, the loader implementation gets it,
hands it to Hazelcast, and Hazelcast puts it into memory. This is read-through
persistence mode.

As you can remember from the introduction of this section, the `IMap.get()` method
triggers the `load()` method in your MapLoader implementation if an entry does not
exist in the memory. In this case, note that the `IMap.get()` method does not create
backup copies for such entries, when the mode is read-through persistence: there is no
need for backups for these entries since if the primary entry is lost, then a read for
the key triggers the `load()` method and loads the entry from the persistence layer.

[[setting-write-through-persistence]]
=== Setting Write-Through Persistence

The `MapStore` interface can be configured to be write-through by setting the `write-delay-seconds`
property to **0**. This means the entries are sent to the data store synchronously.

In this mode, when the `map.put(key,value)` call returns:

* The `MapStore.store(key,value)` method is successfully called so the entry is persisted.
* The in-memory entry is updated.
* Any in-memory backup copies are successfully created on other cluster members
(if the `backup-count` property is greater than 0).

If the `MapStore.store(key,value)` method throws an exception, it is propagated to
the original `IMap.put()` or `IMap.remove()` call in the form of `RuntimeException`.

[[setting-write-behind-persistence]]
=== Setting Write-Behind Persistence

You can configure `MapStore` as write-behind by setting the `write-delay-seconds`
property to a value bigger than **0**. This means the modified entries will be
put to the data store asynchronously after a configured delay.

NOTE: In write-behind mode, Hazelcast coalesces updates on a specific key by
default, which means it applies only the last update on that key. However,
you can set `MapStoreConfig.setWriteCoalescing()` to `FALSE` and you can store
all updates performed on a key to the data store.

NOTE: When you set `MapStoreConfig.setWriteCoalescing()` to `FALSE`, after you
reached per-node maximum write-behind-queue capacity, subsequent put operations
will fail with `ReachedMaxSizeException`. This exception is thrown to prevent
uncontrolled grow of write-behind queues. You can set per-node maximum capacity
using the system property `hazelcast.map.write.behind.queue.capacity`. See the
xref:ROOT:system-properties.adoc[System Properties appendix] for information on this property
and how to set the system properties.


In write-behind mode, when the `map.put(key,value)` call returns:

* in-memory entry is updated
* in-memory backup copies are successfully created on the other cluster members
(if `backup-count` is greater than 0)
* the entry is marked as dirty so that after `write-delay-seconds`, it can be
persisted with `MapStore.store(key,value)` call
* and for fault tolerance, dirty entries are stored in a queue on the primary
member and also on a back-up member.

The same behavior goes for the `map.remove(key)`, the only difference is that
`MapStore.delete(key)` is called when the entry will be deleted.

If `MapStore` throws an exception, then Hazelcast tries to store the entry again.
If the entry still cannot be stored, a log message is printed and the entry is re-queued.

For batch write operations, which are only allowed in write-behind mode,
Hazelcast calls the `MapStore.storeAll(map)` and `MapStore.deleteAll(collection)`
methods to do all writes in a single call.

NOTE: If a map entry is marked as dirty, meaning that it is waiting to be
persisted to the `MapStore` in a write-behind scenario, the eviction process
forces the entry to be stored. This way you have control over the number of
entries waiting to be stored, and thus you can prevent a possible OutOfMemory
exception.

NOTE: `MapStore` or `MapLoader` implementations should not use
Hazelcast Map/Queue/MultiMap/List/Set operations. Your implementation should
only work with your data store. Otherwise, you may get into deadlock situations.

Here is an example configuration:

The following are the descriptions of MapStore configuration elements and attributes:

* `class-name`: Name of the class implementing MapLoader and/or MapStore.
* `write-delay-seconds`: Number of seconds to delay to call the
MapStore.store(key, value). If the value is zero then it is write-through,
so the `MapStore.store(key,value)` method is called as soon as the entry is
updated. Otherwise, it is write-behind; so the updates will be stored after
the `write-delay-seconds` value by calling the `Hazelcast.storeAll(map)` method.
Its default value is 0.
* `write-batch-size`: Used to create batch chunks when writing map store. In
default mode, all map entries are tried to be written in one go. To create
batch chunks, the minimum meaningful value for write-batch-size is 2. For values
smaller than 2, it works as in default mode.
* `write-coalescing`: In write-behind mode, Hazelcast coalesces updates on a
specific key by default; it applies only the last update on it. You can set this
element to `false` to store all updates performed on a key to the data store.
* `enabled`: True to enable this map-store, false to disable. Its default value
is true.
* [[initial-mode]]`initial-mode`: Sets the initial load mode. LAZY is the default load mode, where
load is asynchronous. EAGER means load is blocked till all partitions are loaded.
See the <<initializing-map-on-startup, Initializing Map on Startup section>> for
more details.

=== Managing the Lifecycle of a MapLoader

With `MapLoader` (and `MapStore` which extends it), you can do the regular store and load operations.
If you need to perform other operations on create or on destroy of a `MapLoader`,
such as establishing a connection to a database or accessing to other Hazelcast maps,
you need to implement the `MapLoaderLifeCycleSupport` interface. By implementing
it, you will have the `init()` and `destroy()` methods.

The `init()` method initializes the `MapLoader` implementation. Hazelcast calls
this method when the map is first created on a Hazelcast instance. The `MapLoader`
implementation can initialize the required resources
such as reading a configuration file or creating a database connection
or accessing a Hazelcast instance.

The `destroy()` method is called during the graceful shutdown of a Hazelcast instance.
You can override this method to cleanup the resources held by the `MapLoader` implementation, such as
closing the database connections.

In summary, you need `MapLoaderLifecycleSupport` to perform actions
on create and on destroy of a `MapLoader`.

See https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-code-samples/blob/master/hazelcast-integration/mongodb/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/loader/MongoMapStore.java[here^] to see this interface in action.

[[storing-entries-to-multiple-maps]]
=== Storing Entries to Multiple Maps

A configuration can be applied to more than one map using wildcards
(see xref:configuration:using-wildcards.adoc[Using Wildcards]), meaning that the configuration is
shared among the maps. But `MapStore` does not know which entries to store
when there is one configuration applied to multiple maps.

To store entries when there is one configuration applied to multiple maps,
use Hazelcast's `MapStoreFactory` interface. Using the `MapStoreFactory` interface,
``MapStore``s for each map can be created when a wildcard configuration is used.
Example code is shown below.

[source,java]
----
Config config = new Config();
MapConfig mapConfig = config.getMapConfig( "*" );
MapStoreConfig mapStoreConfig = mapConfig.getMapStoreConfig();
mapStoreConfig.setFactoryImplementation( new MapStoreFactory<Object, Object>() {
    @Override
    public MapLoader<Object, Object> newMapStore( String mapName, Properties properties ) {
        return null;
    }
});
----

To initialize the `MapLoader` implementation with the given map name, configuration
properties and the Hazelcast instance, implement the
https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/{full-version}/javadoc/com/hazelcast/map/MapLoaderLifecycleSupport.html[`MapLoaderLifecycleSupport` interface^]
which is described in the previous section.

[[initializing-map-on-startup]]
=== Initializing Map on Startup

To pre-populate the in-memory map when it is first used, you can
implement the `MapLoader.loadAllKeys()` method. This method is the fastest
way of pre-populating maps because Hazelcast optimizes the loading process
by having each cluster member load its owned portion of the entries.

The `MapLoader.loadAllKeys()` method loads all data from the data store, depending
on whether your `MapStore` or `MapLoader` implementations have their
<<initial-mode, `initial-mode` property>> set to `LAZY` (default) or `EAGER`.

NOTE: If you add indices to your map with the
link:{javadocBaseUrl}/javadoc/com/hazelcast/config/IndexConfig.html[IndexConfig^]
class or the xref:query:how-distributed-query-works.adoc#indexing-queries[`addIndex`] method,
then the `initial-mode` property is overridden by `EAGER`.

[cols="1m,5a"]
|===
|Initial Mode| Behavior

|EAGER
|The `MapLoader.loadAllKeys()` method is invoked the first time you create or get the map.

|LAZY
|After getting or creating the map, the `MapLoader.loadAllKeys()` method is invoked on
each partition the first time that you use any of the `IMap` methods to get a value from that partition

NOTE: For a list of all `IMap` methods that trigger the `MapLoader` methods, see <<map-mapstore, MapStore and MapLoader Methods Triggered by IMap Operations>>
|===

If your implementation of the `MapLoader.loadAllKeys()` method returns a `null` value, nothing will be loaded.
Your `MapLoader.loadAllKeys()` method can also return all or some of the
keys. For example, you may select and return only the keys that are most
important to you.


Here is the `MapLoader` initialization flow:

. When `getMap()` is first called from any member, initialization starts
depending on the value of the `initial-mode` property. If it is set to `EAGER`,
initialization starts on all partitions as soon as the map is created,
i.e., all partitions are loaded when `getMap` is called.  A map is loaded when
the `IMap#getMap` method is called in the `EAGER` mode; otherwise, it is loaded
after the first operation, e.g., `IMap#size`, `IMap#get`, etc. of the map in the `LAZY` mode.
. Hazelcast calls the `MapLoader.loadAllKeys()` to get all your
keys on one of the members.
. That member distributes keys to all other members in batches.
. Each member loads values of all its owned keys by calling
`MapLoader.loadAll(keys)`.
. Each member puts its owned entries into the map by calling
`IMap.putTransient(key,value)`.

NOTE: If the load mode is `LAZY` and the `clear()` method is called
(which triggers `MapStore.deleteAll()`), Hazelcast removes **ONLY** the
loaded entries from your map and datastore. Since all the data is not loaded
in this case (`LAZY` mode), please note that there may still be entries in your datastore.

NOTE: If you do not want the MapStore start to load as soon as the
first cluster member starts, you can use the system property `hazelcast.initial.min.cluster.size`.
For example, if you set its value as `3`, loading process will be
blocked until all three members are completely up.

[[loading-keys-incrementally]]
=== Loading Keys Incrementally

If the number of keys to load is large, it is more efficient to
load them incrementally rather than loading them all at once. To support
incremental loading, the `MapLoader.loadAllKeys()` method returns an `Iterable`
which can be lazily populated with the results of a database query.

NOTE: In Hazelcast IMDG version 3.5, the return type of `loadAllKeys()` 
was changed from a `Set` type to an `Iterable` type. `MapLoader` implementations from previous
releases are also supported and do not need to be adapted.

Hazelcast iterates over the returned data and, while doing so, sends the keys
to their respective owner members. The iterator that was returned from the `MapLoader.loadAllKeys()`
may also implement the `Closeable` interface, in which case the iterator is closed when
the iteration is over. This is intended for releasing resources such as closing a JDBC result set.

[[forcing-all-keys-to-be-loaded]]
=== Forcing All Keys To Be Loaded

The `MapLoader.loadAll()` method loads some or all keys into a
data store in order to optimize multiple load operations. This method has
two signatures (the same method can take two different parameter lists):
One signature loads the given keys and the other loads all keys. See the example code below.

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/dds/map/LoadAll.java[tag=loadall]
----

[[post-processing-objects-in-map-store]]
=== Post-Processing Objects in Map Store

In some scenarios, you may need to modify the object after storing it into
the map store.
For example, you can get an ID or version auto-generated by your database and
then need to modify your object stored in the distributed map, but not to break
the synchronization between the database and the data grid.

To post-process an object in the map store, implement the `PostProcessingMapStore`
interface to put the modified object into the distributed map. This triggers an
extra step of `Serialization`, so use it only when needed. (This is only valid
when using the `write-through` map store configuration.)

Here is an example of post processing map store:

[source,java]
----
class ProcessingStore implements MapStore<Integer, Employee>, PostProcessingMapStore {
    @Override
    public void store( Integer key, Employee employee ) {
        EmployeeId id = saveEmployee();
        employee.setId( id.getId() );
    }
}
----

NOTE: Please note that if you are using a post-processing map store in
combination with the entry processors, post-processed values will not be
carried to backups.

[[accessing-a-database-using-properties]]
=== Accessing a Database Using `Properties`

You can prepare your own `MapLoader` to access a database such as Cassandra
and MongoDB. For this, you can first declaratively specify the database properties
in your `hazelcast.xml` configuration file and then implement the
`MapLoaderLifecycleSupport` interface to pass those properties.

You can define the database properties, such as its URL and name, using the
`properties` configuration element. The following is a configuration example
for MongoDB:

[[map-mapstore]]
=== MapStore and MapLoader Methods Triggered by IMap Operations

As explained in the above sections, you can configure
Hazelcast maps to be backed by a map store to persist the entries.
In this case many of the `IMap` methods call `MapLoader` or `MapStore`
methods to load, store, or remove data. This section summarizes the `IMap`
operations that may trigger the `MapStore` or `MapLoader` methods.

NOTE: If the <<initial-mode, `initial-mode` property>> of the `MapLoader`
implementation is set to `LAZY`, the first time any link:{javadocBaseUrl}/javadoc/com/hazelcast/map/IMap.html[`IMap` method]
is called, it triggers the `MapLoader.loadAllKeys()` method.

[cols="1m,5a"]
|===
|`IMap` Method|Impact on the `MapStore`/`MapLoader` implementations

|flush()
|This method flushes all the local dirty
entries by calling the `MapStore.storeAll(Map)` or
`MapStore.deleteAll(Collection)` methods with the elements marked as dirty.

|* put()
* putAll()
* putAsync()
* tryPut()
* putIfAbsent()
|These methods are used to put entries to the map. They call the
`MapLoader.load(Object)` method for each entry not found in the memory
to load the value from the map store backing the map. They also call the
`MapStore.store(Object, Object)` method for each entry, if write-through
persistence mode is configured before the entry is added into the memory.

|* set()
* setAsync()
|These methods put an entry into the map without returning the old value.
They call the `MapStore.store(Object, Object)` method if write-through
persistence mode is configured before the entry is added into the memory,
to write the value into the map store.

|remove()
|Removes the mapping for a key from the map if it is present. It calls the
`MapLoader.load(Object)` method if no value is found with key in the memory,
to load the value from the map store backing the map. It also calls the
`MapStore.delete(Object)` method if write-through persistence mode is
configured before the value is removed from the memory, to remove the value
from the map store.

|* removeAll()
* delete()
* removeAsync()
* tryRemove()
|These methods are used to remove entries from the map for various conditions.
They call the `MapStore.delete(Object)` method if write-through persistence mode
is configured before the value is removed from the memory, to remove the value
from the map store.

| * setTtl
| This method updates time-to-live of an existing entry. It calls the `MapLoader.load(Object)`
method if no value is found in the memory. It also calls `EntryStore.store(Object, MetadataAwareValue)`
with the entry whose time-to-live has been updated.

|clear()
|It clears the map and deletes the items from the backing map store. It calls
the `MapStore.deleteAll(Collection)` method on each partition with the keys that the
given partition stores.

|replace()
|It replaces the entry for a key only if currently mapped to a given value.
It calls the `MapStore.store(Object, Object)` method if write-through persistence
mode is configured before the value is stored in the memory, to write the value into
the map store. 

|* executeOnKey()
* executeOnKeys()
* submitToKey()
* executeOnAllEntries()
|These methods apply the user defined entry processors to the entry or entries.
They call the `MapLoader.load(Object)` method if the value with key is not found in the
memory, to load the value from the map store backing the map. If the entry processor
updates the entry and write-through persistence mode is configured, before the value is
stored in memory, they call the `MapStore.store(Object, Object)` method to write the value
into the map store. If the entry processor updates the entry's value to null value and write-through
persistence mode is configured, before the value is removed from the memory, they call the
`MapStore.delete(Object)` method to delete the value from the map store.

[[creating-near-cache-for-map]]
== Creating Near Cache for Map

The Hazelcast distributed map supports a local Near Cache for
remotely stored entries to increase the performance of local
read operations. See the xref:performance:near-cache.adoc[Near Cache section] for a
detailed explanation of the Near Cache feature and its configuration.

[[locking-maps]]
== Locking Maps

Hazelcast Distributed Map (IMap) is thread-safe to meet your thread
safety requirements. When these requirements increase or you want to
have more control on the concurrency, consider the Hazelcast solutions described here.

Consider the following example:

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/dds/map/RacyUpdateMember.java[tag=racy]
----

If the above code is run by more than one cluster member simultaneously,
a race condition is likely. You can solve this condition with Hazelcast
using either pessimistic or optimistic locking.

[[pessimistic-locking]]
=== Pessimistic Locking

One way to solve the race issue is by using pessimistic locking -
lock the map entry until you are finished with it.

To perform pessimistic locking, use the lock mechanism provided by the
Hazelcast distributed map, i.e., the `map.lock` and `map.unlock` methods.
See the below example code.


[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/dds/map/PessimisticUpdateMember.java[tag=pum]
----

The IMap lock will automatically be collected by the garbage collector
when the lock is released and no other waiting conditions exist on the lock.

The IMap lock is reentrant, but it does not support fairness.

WARNING: In some cases, a client application connected to your
cluster may cause the entries in a map to remain locked
after the application has been restarted (which were already locked
before such a restart). This can be due to the
reasons such as incomplete/incorrect client implementations. In these cases,
you can unlock the entries, either from the thread which locked them
using the `IMap.unlock()` method, or check if the entry is locked
using the `IMap.isLock()` method and then call `IMap.forceUnlock()`.

TIP: For the above case, as a workaround, you can also kill all the applications connected
to the cluster and use the Management Center's scripting functionality to clear the map and
release the locks (instead of using `IMap.forceUnlock()`). Keep in mind that the scripting
functionality is limited to working with maps that have primitive key types, e.g., string keys
and limited to relaying only a single string of output per member to the result panel in the Management Center.

Another way to solve the race issue is by acquiring a predictable `Lock`
object from Hazelcast. This way, every value in the map can be given a lock,
or you can create a stripe of locks.

[[optimistic-locking]]
=== Optimistic Locking

In Hazelcast, you can apply the optimistic locking strategy with the
map's `replace` method. This method compares values in object or data forms
depending on the in-memory format configuration. If the values are equal,
it replaces the old value with the new one. If you want to use your defined
`equals` method, `in-memory-format` should be `OBJECT`. Otherwise, Hazelcast
serializes objects to `BINARY` forms and compares them.

See the below example code.

NOTE: The below example code is intentionally broken.

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/dds/map/OptimisticMember.java[tag=om]
----

[[pessimistic-vs-optimistic-locking]]
=== Pessimistic vs. Optimistic Locking

The locking strategy you choose depends on your locking requirements.

Optimistic locking is better for mostly read-only systems. It has a
performance boost over pessimistic locking.

Pessimistic locking is good if there are lots of updates on the same
key. It is more robust than optimistic locking from the perspective of data consistency.

In Hazelcast, use `IExecutorService` to submit a task to a key owner,
or to a member or members. This is the recommended way to perform task executions,
rather than using pessimistic or optimistic locking techniques. `IExecutorService`
has fewer network hops and less data over wire, and tasks are executed very near to the data.
See the xref:performance:data-affinity.adoc[Data Affinity section].

[[solving-the-aba-problem]]
=== Solving the ABA Problem

The ABA problem occurs in environments when a shared resource is
open to change by multiple threads. Even if one thread sees the same value
for a particular key in consecutive reads, it does not mean that nothing
has changed between the reads. Another thread may change the value,
do work and change the value back, while the first thread thinks that nothing has changed.

To prevent these kind of problems, you can assign a version number and
check it before any write to be sure that nothing has changed between consecutive reads.
Although all the other fields are equal, the version field will prevent objects
from being seen as equal. This is the optimistic locking strategy; it is used in
environments that do not expect intensive concurrent changes on a specific key.

In Hazelcast, you can apply the <<optimistic-locking, optimistic locking>>
strategy with the map `replace` method.

[[lock-split-brain-protection-with-pessimistic-locking]]
=== Lock Split-Brain Protection with Pessimistic Locking

Locks can be configured to check the number of currently present members
before applying a locking operation. If the check fails, the lock operation
fails with a `SplitBrainProtectionException` (see the xref:network-partitioning:split-brain-protection.adoc[Split-Brain Protection section]).
As pessimistic locking uses lock operations internally, it also uses the configured
lock split-brain protection. This means that you can configure a lock split-brain protection with the same name or a
pattern that matches the map name. Note that the split-brain protection for IMap locking actions can be
different from the split-brain protection for other IMap actions.

The following actions check for lock split-brain protection before being applied:

* `IMap.lock(K)` and `IMap.lock(K, long, java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit)`
* `IMap.isLocked()`
* `IMap.tryLock(K)`, `IMap.tryLock(K, long, java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit)` and
`IMap.tryLock(K, long, java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit, long, java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit)`
* `IMap.unlock()`
* `IMap.forceUnlock()`
* `MultiMap.lock(K)` and `MultiMap.lock(K, long, java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit)`
* `MultiMap.isLocked()`
* `MultiMap.tryLock(K)`, `MultiMap.tryLock(K, long, java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit)`
and `MultiMap.tryLock(K, long, java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit, long, java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit)`
* `MultiMap.unlock()`
* `MultiMap.forceUnlock()`

Here the configured map uses the `map-lock-actions-split-brain-protection` for

[[accessing-entry-statistics]]
== Accessing Map and Entry Statistics

You can retrieve the statistics of maps in your Hazelcast IMDG members using the
`getLocalMapStats()` method.
It returns information such as primary and backup entry count, last update
time and locked entry count. If you need the cluster-wide map statistics, you can
get the local map statistics from all members of the cluster and combine them.
Alternatively, you can see the map statistics on
xref:management-center:monitor-imdg:monitor-dds.adoc#managing-maps[Hazelcast Management Center].

To be able to retrieve the statistics on map level, you should set `statistics-enabled`
under the map configuration as `true`, which is also the default value:

[tabs] 
==== 
XML:: 
+ 
-- 
[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
    ...
    <map name="myMap">
        <statistics-enabled>true</statistics-enabled>
    </map>
    ...
</hazelcast>
----
--

YAML::
+
[source,yaml]
----
hazelcast:
  map:
    myMap:
      statistics-enabled: true
----
====

If it is `false`, the statistics are not gathered
for the map: you cannot see them on the Hazelcast Management Center, nor retrieve
using `getLocalMapStats()`.

When enabled, you can simply use `getLocalMapStats()`, an example of which is shown below:

[source,java]
----
HazelcastInstance hc = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();
    IMap<String, String> myMap = hc.getMap( "myMap" );
    LocalMapStats mapStatistics = myMap.getLocalMapStats();
    System.out.println( "Number of entries owned on this member = "
        + mapStatistics.getOwnedEntryCount() );
----


Using the same method, you can also retrieve the statistics on entry level.
For this, you should set `per-entry-stats-enabled` under the map configuration as
`true` (its default value is `false`):

[tabs] 
==== 
XML:: 
+ 
-- 
[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
    ...
    <map name="myMap">
        <per-entry-stats-enabled>true</per-entry-stats-enabled>
    </map>
    ...
</hazelcast>
----
--

YAML::
+
[source,yaml]
----
hazelcast:
  map:
    myMap:
      per-entry-stats-enabled: true
----
====

When enabled, you can retrieve map entry statistics such as last accessed/updated time, creation
time and last stored time, again using the `getLocalMapStats()` method.

Also, when enabled, the fields in the `getEntryView(key)` operation becomes
visible. This method returns an overview of a map entry specified by its key.
Here is an example.

[source,java]
----
HazelcastInstance hz = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();
EntryView entry = hz.getMap( "quotes" ).getEntryView( "1" );
System.out.println ( "size in memory  : " + entry.getCost() );
System.out.println ( "creationTime    : " + entry.getCreationTime() );
System.out.println ( "expirationTime  : " + entry.getExpirationTime() );
System.out.println ( "number of hits  : " + entry.getHits() );
System.out.println ( "lastAccessedTime: " + entry.getLastAccessTime() );
System.out.println ( "lastUpdateTime  : " + entry.getLastUpdateTime() );
System.out.println ( "version         : " + entry.getVersion() );
System.out.println ( "key             : " + entry.getKey() );
System.out.println ( "value           : " + entry.getValue() );

[[listening-to-map-entries-with-predicates]]
== Listening to Map Entries with Predicates

You can think of it as an entry listener with predicates.

NOTE: See the xref:events:object-events.adoc#listening-for-map-events[Listening for Map Events section] for information on the listeners for Hazelcast maps and how to use them.

NOTE: The default backwards-compatible event publishing strategy only publishes
`UPDATED` events when map entries are updated to a value that
matches the predicate with which the listener was registered.
This implies that when using the default event publishing strategy,
your listener is not notified about an entry whose
value is updated from one that matches the predicate to a new value
that does not match the predicate.

Since version 3.7, when you configure Hazelcast members with property
`hazelcast.map.entry.filtering.natural.event.types` set to `true`,
handling of entry updates conceptually treats value transition as entry,
update or exit with regards to the predicate value space.
The following table compares how a listener is notified about an update
to a map entry value under the default
backwards-compatible Hazelcast behavior (when property
`hazelcast.map.entry.filtering.natural.event.types` is not set or is set
to `false`) versus when set to `true`:

|===

|| Default | `hazelcast.map.entry.filtering.natural.event.types = true`

| When old value matches predicate, new value does not match predicate
| No event is delivered to entry listener
| `REMOVED` event is delivered to entry listener

| When old value matches predicate, new value matches predicate
| `UPDATED` event is delivered to entry listener
| `UPDATED` event is delivered to entry listener

| When old value does not match predicate, new value does not match predicate
| No event is delivered to entry listener
| No event is delivered to entry listener

| When old value does not match predicate, new value matches predicate
| `UPDATED` event is delivered to entry listener
| `ADDED` event is delivered to entry listener
|===

As an example, let's listen to the changes made on an employee
with the surname "Smith". First, let's create the `Employee` class.

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/dds/map/Employee.java[tag=emp]
----

Then, let's create a listener with predicate by adding a listener
that tracks `ADDED`, `UPDATED` and `REMOVED` entry events with the `surname` predicate.

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/dds/map/ListenerWithPredicate.java[tag=lwp]
----


And now, let's play with the employee "smith" and see how that employee is listened to.

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/dds/map/Modify.java[tag=modify]
----


When you first run the class `ListenerWithPredicate` and then run `Modify`,
an output similar to the one below appears.

```
entryAdded:EntryEvent {Address[192.168.178.10]:5702} key=1,oldValue=null,
value=Person{name= smith }, event=ADDED, by Member [192.168.178.10]:5702
```

NOTE: See the xref:query:continuous-query-cache.adoc[Continuous Query Cache section]
for more information.

[[removing-map-entries-in-bulk-with-predicates]]
== Removing Map Entries in Bulk with Predicates

You can remove all map entries that match your predicate. For this,
Hazelcast offers the method `removeAll()`. Its syntax is as follows:

[source,java]
----
void removeAll(Predicate<K, V> predicate);
----

Normally the map entries matching the predicate are found with a full scan
of the map. If the entries are indexed, Hazelcast uses the index search to find them.
With index, you can expect that finding the entries is faster.


NOTE: When `removeAll()` is called, ALL entries in the caller member's
Near Cache are also removed.

[[adding-interceptors]]
== Adding Interceptors

You can add intercept operations and execute your own business logic
synchronously blocking the operations. You can change the returned value
from a `get` operation, change the value in `put`, or `cancel` operations
by throwing an exception.

Interceptors are different from listeners. With listeners, you take an action
after the operation has been completed. Interceptor actions are synchronous and
you can alter the behavior of operation, change its values, or totally cancel it.

Map interceptors are chained, so adding the same interceptor multiple times to the
same map can result in duplicate effects. This can easily happen when the interceptor
is added to the map at member initialization, so that each member adds the same interceptor.
When you add the interceptor in this way, be sure to implement the `hashCode()`
method to return the same value for every instance of the interceptor.
It is not strictly necessary, but it is a good idea to also implement `equals()`
as this ensures that the map interceptor can be removed reliably.

The IMap API has two methods for adding and removing an interceptor to the map:
`addInterceptor` and `removeInterceptor`. See also the
https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/{full-version}/javadoc/com/hazelcast/map/MapInterceptor.html[`MapInterceptor` interface^]
to learn about the methods used to intercept the changes in a map.

The following is an example usage.

[source,java]
----
include::{javasource}/dds/map/MapInterceptorMember.java[tag=mim]
----

[[preventing-out-of-memory-exceptions]]
== Preventing Out of Memory Exceptions

It is very easy to trigger an out of memory exception (OOME) with query-based map methods,
especially with large clusters or heap sizes. For example, on a cluster with five members
having 10 GB of data and 25 GB heap size per member, a single call of `IMap.entrySet()`
fetches 50 GB of data and crashes the calling instance.

A call of `IMap.values()` may return too much data for a single member.
This can also happen with a real query and an unlucky choice of predicates,
especially when the parameters are chosen by a user of your application.

To prevent this, you can configure a maximum result size limit for query based operations.
This is not a limit like `SELECT * FROM map LIMIT 100`, which you can achieve by a
xref:query:how-distributed-query-works.adoc#filtering-with-paging-predicates[Paging Predicate]. A maximum result size limit
for query based operations is meant to be a last line of defense to prevent your members
from retrieving more data than they can handle.

The Hazelcast component which calculates this limit is the `QueryResultSizeLimiter`.

[[setting-query-result-size-limit]]
=== Setting Query Result Size Limit

If the `QueryResultSizeLimiter` is activated, it calculates a result size limit per partition.
Each `QueryOperation` runs on all partitions of a member, so it collects result entries
as long as the member limit is not exceeded. If that happens, a
`QueryResultSizeExceededException` is thrown and propagated to the calling instance.

This feature depends on an equal distribution of the data on the cluster members to
calculate the result size limit per member. Therefore, there is a minimum value defined
in `QueryResultSizeLimiter.MINIMUM_MAX_RESULT_LIMIT`. Configured values below the minimum
will be increased to the minimum.

[[local-pre-check]]
=== Local Pre-check

In addition to the distributed result size check in the `QueryOperations`,
there is a local pre-check on the calling instance. If you call the method from a client,
the pre-check is executed on the member that invokes the `QueryOperations`.

Since the local pre-check can increase the latency of a `QueryOperation`,
you can configure how many local partitions should be considered for the pre-check,
or you can deactivate the feature completely.

[[scope-of-result-size-limit]]
=== Scope of Result Size Limit

Besides the designated query operations, there are other operations that use predicates internally.
Those method calls throw the `QueryResultSizeExceededException` as well.
See the following matrix for the methods that are covered by the query result size limit.

image:ROOT:Map-QueryResultSizeLimiterScope.png[Methods Covered by Query Result Size Limit]

[[configuring-query-result-size]]
=== Configuring Query Result Size

The query result size limit is configured via the following system properties.

* `hazelcast.query.result.size.limit`: Result size limit for query operations on maps.
This value defines the maximum number of returned elements for a single query result.
If a query exceeds this number of elements, a QueryResultSizeExceededException is thrown.
* `hazelcast.query.max.local.partition.limit.for.precheck`: Maximum value of local partitions
to trigger local pre-check for `Predicates#alwaysTrue()` query operations on maps.

See the xref:ROOT:system-properties.adoc[System Properties appendix] to see the full descriptions
of these properties and how to set them.
