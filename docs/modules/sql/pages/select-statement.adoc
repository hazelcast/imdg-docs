== Description

The `SELECT` command retrieves rows from a table. A row is a sequence of expressions defined after the `SELECT` keyword.
Expressions may have optional aliases.

`table_name` refers to a single `IMap` data structure. A table may have an optional alias.

An optional `WHERE` clause defines a `condition`, that is any expression that evaluates to a result of type boolean.
Any row that doesn't satisfy the condition is eliminated from the result.
