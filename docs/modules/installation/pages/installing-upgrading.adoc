= Installing and Upgrading

This chapter provides pre- and post-installation
details, and deployment options of Hazelcast IMDG.

Hazelcast IMDG provides a number of options on how to install it.
Here's a brief overview of them:

* xref:installing-using-cli.adoc[]: Fastest way of getting Hazelcast IMDG running (in the client/server mode).
Currently not suitable for production usage, but rather for development purposes.
* xref:installing-using-maven.adoc[]: Easiest way for Maven users (typically Java developers), especially appropriate
for the embedded mode when Hazelcast IMDG is tightly coupled with the application.
* xref:installing-using-docker.adoc[]: One line Docker based setup.
* xref:installing-using-download-archives.adoc[]: Provides the most flexibility and all the tooling, but takes a little longer time.
